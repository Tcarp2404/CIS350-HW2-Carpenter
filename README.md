### Technical background - I have taken classes in computing for example CIS 162 and CIS 163. These classes had a large focus on teaching the basics of python and working upwards into more detailed python. We did several projects of coding that progressivley got harder and harder as we did them, we also had labs each week where we had to complete in class activities. Another class I have taken is intro to cyber-security which teaches the basics of cyber-secruity. Discrete Structures Computer Science 1 is the last class dedicated to computer science I ahve taken, the focuses are more on math but it also explores python as well.
